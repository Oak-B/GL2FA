This is the PyTorch implementation for our paper entitiled “Graph Linear Convolution Pooling for Learning in Incomplete High-Dimensional Data”.

We implement all the experiments in Python 3.7, and deploy them on a server with one 2.4-GHz Intel Xeon 4214R CPU, four NVIDIA RTX 3090 GPUs, and 128-GB RAM. 
We may create an environment using: `conda create --name <env> --file requirements.txt`, or install the required packages using: `conda install --file requirements.txt`
